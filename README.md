Python Exercise
Introduction
Welcome to our programming challenge! This task is designed to acquaint you with our domain while assessing your fundamental Python programming skills and your ability to quickly adapt to new packages and technologies.
The objective of this exercise is to provide you with a glimpse into the realm of our generative AI domain. By completing this task, we aim to evaluate your proficiency in Python programming, understanding of essential backend concepts, and your capability to swiftly grasp and apply new libraries or frameworks.
This exercise is not solely about achieving the perfect solution but rather about demonstrating your approach, reasoning, and adaptability when confronted with new technologies or requirements. 
This task can take a few minutes to 1 hour, depending on the familiarity with the domain. We are not testing the time, although we would like to know how much time it took. In any case, no longer than 3 hours should be spent on this task.
Feel free to contact Wisery’s team on any question you have.  
Thank you for participating, and we look forward to seeing your insights and solutions!

Ask My Doc Service
In this task, we would like you to develop a python service that receives a question on this word document, and return an answer, based on the information on this document. For example, the service may get a question: “What is the title of the document?” and will return “Python Exercise”.
Main requirements: 
1.	The service should use REST API for receiving questions and returning their answers. 
2.	Answers will be based solely on this document.
3.	You can use langchain (https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain) or llama-index (https://www.llamaindex.ai/ ) for question-answering over word document.
4.	Write a production-grade code: typing, error handling, structure etc.
5.	You can use ChatGPT, and if needed, we can provide you with a key.
6.	Bonus: code should be delivered and executed using docker-compose. Something like: docker-compose up -d ask_my_doc_service 


מותר להיעזר באינטרנט (גוגל, chatgpt וכו'). אנחנו לא בודקים זיכרון, רק חשיבה. כמובן שלא ניתן להיעזר באנשים אחרים. אנחנו מבינים שחבילות פייתון לא מוכרות לרוב המועמדים.

Once the service is ready, please answer the following questions:
1.	What type of questions worked? What questions did not work?
2.	What improvements should be made to the service to support the non-answered questions?
3.	Design and architecture to support parallel loading of 100M documents.
